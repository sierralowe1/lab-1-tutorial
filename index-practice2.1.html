        <h1> 1 Thing That Fascinates Me!</h1>
        <h2> Space is Completely Silent</h2>
        <p>  Why is space completely, silent? In spacce, where there are no atoms or molecules, it cannot carry the wave of sound. Sound is carried by molecules and atoms, 
            so you will hear complete silence, not a pin dropping or a hand hitting a table, gravity is also the main cause of force.
